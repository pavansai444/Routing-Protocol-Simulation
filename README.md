# Routing Protocol Simulation
 implemented various routing protocols in java ans simulated using ns2
Wireless Protocols: 

We conducted simulations using the ns2 simulator to evaluate different ad hoc protocols in a dynamic and resource-constrained environment, where the number of nodes varied, such as in a 50-node network. During these simulations, we analysed trace files to gather valuable metrics, including throughput, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and the counts of dropped, received, and sent packets.And also, we coded tcl ,awk files to get the results.

 Wired Protocols: 

 

We have implemented Java code to execute the algorithms associated with both distance vector and link state protocols. This code enables us to derive the routing tables for each router. Subsequently, we generate a TCL (Tool Command Language) script, which serves as the basis for simulating these protocols in ns2 simulator. Additionally, we employ an AWK script (a scripting language) to parse the trace file, extracting critical metrics such as throughput, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, as well as the quantities of dropped, received, and transmitted packets. In our analysis, we also utilize the X Graph tool to visually represent the throughput data through graph plotting.

Upgradation to wired Network Protocols: 

we have employed Java programming to deploy the advanced OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol, which represents a significant leap beyond the conventional link state protocol. OSPF's dynamic updates and real-time routing table management for each router make it a powerful tool for optimizing network performance. By integrating OSPF into our simulations, we have enabled the NS2 simulator to dynamically respond to network changes, showcasing OSPF's capacity for highly responsive and efficient routing in complex network environments.
